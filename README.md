Assignment 5



This project's goal was to build a database using a Binary Search Tree.
This includes a template binary tree, a template doubly linkedlist, and a template Stack.
It also includes a Person class, a Student and Faculty class, a masterStudent and masterFaculty class, a Menu class, a FileReader class, a main and a few Exception classes.

This project was lengthy and really tedious. I learnt a lot on how to interact with classes and pointers as well as traversing nodes and combining different objects.
We encountered problems while trying to read the Advisee's information based on the Advisor (Choice number 6).

We did not manage to use the stack correctly to rollback (Choice number 13).
We created a saveFile function which is based on the recursive pattern from the binary tree methods (inOrder, PostOrder...) to write all the data in another file. However, we did not find a way to add the file directly into the stack as a copy of the data after being manipulated.

An stoi error may appear when the text file created is too big as well, the best way I found to get rid off this error is to call make realclean and or deleting some of my examples.
We did not make our file reading in binary because it was always throwing some type of error.
We tried our best.
